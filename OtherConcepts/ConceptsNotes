1. Promises 
    Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They are easy to manage when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations where callbacks can create callback hell leading to unmanageable code.

    Callback hell is a phenomenon that afflicts a JavaScript developer when he tries to execute multiple asynchronous operations one after the other


A Promise has four states:

    - fulfilled: Action related to the promise succeeded
    - rejected: Action related to the promise failed
    - pending: Promise is still pending i.e not fulfilled or rejected yet
    - settled: Promise has fulfilled or rejected

=> 
    The handling of this is also different in arrow functions compared to regular functions.

    In short, with arrow functions there are no binding of this.

    In regular functions the this keyword represented the object that called the function, which could be the window, the document, a button or whatever.

    With arrow functions the this keyword always represents the object that defined the arrow function.
