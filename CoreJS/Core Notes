1. Call Bind and Apply

    The call, bind and apply methods can be used to set the this keyword independent of how a function is called. 
    The bind method creates a copy of the function and sets the this keyword, while the call and apply methods 
    sets the this keyword and calls the function immediately.


    - In Call method we can pass the arguments individually coma separated.
    - In apply method we cac pass the arguments as array list.
    - Bind method is similar to call but does not directly calls the function instead it returns a copy stored in a varuable which can be invoked later.

2. Polyfill for bind is used when we need to implement our own bind method.

3. Currying
    Currying refers to the process of transforming a function with multiple arity into the same function with less arity. The curried effect is achieved 
    by binding some of the arguments to the first function invoke, so that those values are fixed for the next invocation.

    2 Ways to perform currying- using bind , using closures. (See js file)

4. Debouncing and Throttling are used for optimization by limiting the rate of function calls.

5. Debouncing
    The debounce() function forces a function to wait a certain amount of time before running again. The function is built to limit
     the number of times a function is called. ... The function aims to reduce overhead by preventing a function from being called 
     several times in succession.

6. Throttling
    Throttling is a technique in which, no matter how many times the user fires the event, the attached function will be executed 
    only once in a given time interval.
