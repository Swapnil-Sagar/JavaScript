1. Callbacks are used to handle async operations in JS.

   1.1. Issues of callbacks
   a. Callback Hell - When multiple functions are used as callbacks inside one another. This will cause a 'pyramid of doom' like structure.
   b. Inversion of control - When we looses the control of our functions and give it to another function.

2. Promises - it is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

   2.1. Promise data are immutable.
   2.2. Promise has 3 states - Pending, Fulfilled and Rejected.
   2.3. Promise chaining helps resolve callback hell.
